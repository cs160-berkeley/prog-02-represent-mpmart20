# PROG 02: Represent!

Known Issues:

Wear:
Images make watch bulky and crashes it
Not sure why it will not do a "debug merge" with certain photos on wear
Crashes randomly
Gives error: Must uninstall app then reinstall 
    Gets stuck in a loop unless I restart my computer, where it'll eventually happen again
Gives no error messages on crashes
Freezes a lot, take ~30 + mins to load while on 4 secs to compile

Mobile:
Swipe screen not enabled
UI could use some work

Wear+Mobile:
Not able to work confidently on communication between devices because of watch unresponsiveness most of the time
    See video for lag in swipes and just late registry of everything (and that was the best it has ever been stability wise)
Screens should be implemented and connected through swiping (both up and down for category and left and right for subinformation)
